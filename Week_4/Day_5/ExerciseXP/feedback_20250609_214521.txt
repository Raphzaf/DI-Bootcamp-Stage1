suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1 and 2,  the console logging of the entire data object and the GIF array is slightly redundant.  Consider only logging the relevant `data.data` array directly for better clarity.
- Add comments to the code explaining the purpose of different sections, especially in Exercise 3 where the `async/await` logic is used. This enhances readability.
- Exercise 4 doesn't require any changes; the code correctly demonstrates the use of async/await and Promises.  Consider adding a comment to explain the output - 'calling', then after 2 seconds 'resolved'.
Correctness: 95%
