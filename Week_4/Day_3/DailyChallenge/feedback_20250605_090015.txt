suggestions for improvement:
- The script.js file is missing.  The code needs to include the JavaScript functionality to handle form submission and JSON output.  Without it, the core functionality is not implemented.
- Add input validation to prevent non-alphabetic characters in the name and lastname fields.
- Consider using more descriptive IDs for elements (e.g., 'firstName' instead of 'name').
- Improve error handling.  What happens if a user doesn't fill both fields and submits?

suggestions for improvement:
- Add input validation to handle empty fields or unexpected input.  The current code will display an empty JSON object if the user doesn't enter data.
- Consider using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities, although this is already done correctly.
- Improve the visual presentation of the JSON output (e.g., using `<pre>` tags for formatting).
- Add error handling for cases where the form elements (e.g., 'name', 'lastname', 'output') are not found.
