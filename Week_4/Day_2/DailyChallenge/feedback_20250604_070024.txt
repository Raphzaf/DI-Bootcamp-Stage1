suggestions for improvement:
- The `Video` class correctly implements the `watch()` method as specified.
- The code instantiates two `Video` objects and calls the `watch()` method on them as required.
- The bonus parts are missing.  The code doesn't create an array to store data for five `Video` instances and doesn't loop through the array to instantiate those instances.
- Consider adding error handling (e.g., type checking for input parameters in the `Video` constructor) to improve robustness.
- The HTML file is a basic structure and doesn't actually display the video information. The javascript code is missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `alert` in the `watch()` method could be improved.  Consider using `console.log` for debugging or a more user-friendly method like displaying the message within the webpage itself (which the code partially does with the button).
- The code adds extra functionality beyond the core requirements (creating and adding the videos to the DOM). While this is a good addition, it makes the code more complex than what is strictly asked for in the prompt.
- The bonus section is well implemented by using `map` to create the instances from the array.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is missing the `Video` class and its `watch()` method, which are core requirements of the exercise.
- The bonus parts (array of videos and instantiation loop) are not implemented.
- The provided HTML/CSS is not directly related to the Javascript functionality and is not part of the challenge's requirements.  It's good styling, but irrelevant for the grading.
- Add error handling to ensure that the input parameters for the Video class are of the correct type.
