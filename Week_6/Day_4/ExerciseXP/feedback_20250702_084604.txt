suggestions for improvement:
- The `shop.js` file is missing, which is a crucial part of Exercise 1.  The provided code only shows the `products.js` file and the `products` array.  The exercise requires creating a `shop.js` file that imports this array, searches for products, and prints details.
- Add error handling to the `shop.js` (once implemented) to gracefully handle cases where a product is not found.  Currently, if a product is not found, it may cause an error.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code could include error handling for the case where the `persons` array is empty.  This would prevent a division by zero error.
- Adding a more descriptive variable name than `people` in the `calculateAverageAge` function would slightly improve readability (e.g., `persons` to match the imported variable).
- Consider adding a comment explaining the use of `toFixed(2)` to round the average age to two decimal places.
