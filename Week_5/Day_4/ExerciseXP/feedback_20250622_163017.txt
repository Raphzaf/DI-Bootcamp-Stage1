suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, adding a check to ensure the array is not empty before accessing `arr[0]` would improve robustness.  A simple `if (arr.length > 0)` check would prevent an error if an empty array is passed.
- Exercise 7's `formatInput` function relies on the `toString()` method's output. While generally safe, explicitly stating in comments or the function description that unexpected behaviors might occur if the `toString()` method returns something unexpected would enhance clarity.
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling in `describeEmployee` (Exercise 6) to account for unexpected data in the `employee` object or potential null or undefined values.
