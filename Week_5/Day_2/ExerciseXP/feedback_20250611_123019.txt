suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 7, add an actual `<input id="username" />` element to the HTML for the code to work correctly.  The current code will throw an error because `document.getElementById("username")` will return null if no such element exists.
- Improve variable naming in Exercise 2. `userName` could be shortened to `name` for better readability.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of function overloading in Exercise 9 for better understanding.
