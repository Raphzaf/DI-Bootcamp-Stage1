suggestions for improvement:
- The function should explicitly handle the 'undefined' type, as it's a common JavaScript type.
- The use of `any` for `value` is generally discouraged.  It's better to use a more specific type or a union type if you anticipate different input types.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of the null check and the logic within the function.
