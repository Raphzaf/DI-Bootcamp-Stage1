suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation to the `addBook` method to prevent adding books with duplicate ISBNs.
- The `getBookDetails` method could be improved by returning a boolean indicating if a book with the specified ISBN was found, or throwing an error if there is no such book. This approach could be more robust and less error-prone than returning null.
- For larger libraries, consider using a more efficient data structure for storing books (like a Map using ISBN as the key) to improve the performance of `getBookDetails`.
