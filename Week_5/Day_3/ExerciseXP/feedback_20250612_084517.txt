suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, add a getter method for the `salary` property to demonstrate access control effectively.  While the current implementation correctly uses access modifiers, showing how to access private and protected properties with dedicated methods would enhance understanding.
- In Exercise 2, explicitly demonstrate the immutability of the `readonly` property by attempting to change it and handling the error (or lack thereof).  This would provide a more robust example illustrating the `readonly` modifier's behavior.
- In Exercise 5, the `PremiumUser` interface is missing a closing brace `}`.  This is a syntax error that should be corrected.
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling or input validation where appropriate (e.g., checking for null or undefined values in the constructors).
