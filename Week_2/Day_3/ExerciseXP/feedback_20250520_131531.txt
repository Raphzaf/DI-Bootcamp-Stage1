suggestions for improvement:
- In the Currency class, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods could be improved by handling pluralization of the currency name more robustly.  Currently, it always adds 's'. Consider a conditional check based on amount.
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes for better readability and maintainability.
- In Exercise 2,  it would be better practice to explicitly state the file path for `func.py` when importing it. Relative paths (such as './func') can improve portability, especially when the script is moved to different directory locations.
- Exercise 7: While functional, the code doesn't handle potential exceptions from the `faker` library (e.g., network issues). Adding exception handling would improve robustness.
