suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file should handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions during file loading.  A `try-except` block would improve robustness.
- The performance of `get_anagrams` could be significantly improved by pre-processing the word list to group words by their sorted character sets. This would avoid unnecessary comparisons.
- Add more comprehensive input validation in `anagrams.py` to handle edge cases and provide more informative error messages to the user.
- Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `file` in the `__init__` method.  For example, `wordlist_file`.
- The `anagrams.py` file is missing, which prevents a complete assessment of the UI functionality. The instructions require a separate file for user interface.

suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling: Provide more specific error messages to the user (e.g., 'Word not found in dictionary').
- Enhance `get_anagrams` efficiency:  The current implementation likely has a nested loop which is O(n^2) complexity.  Consider using more efficient algorithms like sorting or hashing to reduce the time complexity.
- Add input validation for empty strings:  The code doesn't explicitly check for empty strings.
- Improve User Interface: The UI could be made more user-friendly with clearer prompts and better formatting of output.
- Add a progress indicator for large word lists: The program might take a while for very large word lists. Consider adding a progress bar or other indicator to show the processing progress.
