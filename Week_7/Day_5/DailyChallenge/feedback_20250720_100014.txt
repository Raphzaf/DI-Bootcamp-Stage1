suggestions for improvement:
- The initial votes in the `useState` hook should be 0 as per the instructions.  Currently, they are pre-populated with values.
- Consider using more semantic HTML elements instead of relying heavily on `div` elements and inline styles.  For example, use a `<button>` element instead of a `<div>` with a button style.
- Improve styling using CSS classes instead of inline styles for better maintainability and separation of concerns.
- Add error handling or a loading state to make the application more robust (although not explicitly required).

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided `App.js` file only renders a `VotingApp` component.  The core logic for the voting app (handling state, updating votes) is missing from this file and presumably resides in `VotingApp.js`, which is not provided. The instructions clearly state that the voting app logic should be implemented within `App.js`.
- The `App.js` file itself is perfectly readable and well-structured, but it doesn't fulfill the requirements of the task.
