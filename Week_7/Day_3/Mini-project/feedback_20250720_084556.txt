suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling to provide more specific error messages to the client.  Instead of generic 'Internal Server Error', provide details about the file I/O errors or validation failures.
- Consider using a more robust database solution (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for production environments instead of JSON file storage.  JSON files are not ideal for high concurrency or large datasets.
- Add input validation for the `id` parameter in the `GET /tasks/:id`, `PUT /tasks/:id`, and `DELETE /tasks/:id` routes to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.  Check if the ID is a valid UUID.
- The use of `escapeHtml` is good for basic sanitization, but for a production system, a more comprehensive input validation and sanitization library should be considered to prevent various types of XSS attacks.
- Add unit tests to ensure the API functions correctly and consistently.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Raphzaf/DI-Bootcamp-Stage1/blob/main/Week_7/Day_3/Mini-project/package-lock.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a `package-lock.json` file, which is a dependency management file for npm (Node Package Manager). It does not contain any implementation of an Express.js API.
- To address the chapter content, you need to provide the actual Express.js code with routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks from a JSON file.
- Implement error handling for file I/O and input validation.
- Use asynchronous file operations for better performance.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Raphzaf/DI-Bootcamp-Stage1/blob/main/Week_7/Day_3/Mini-project/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- This is a `package.json` file, not an implementation of the task management API.  It only sets up the project dependencies. The actual code for the API routes, file handling, and validation is missing.
- Implement the Express.js routes as described in the chapter content.  This includes GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for tasks, along with file reading and writing functionality for `tasks.json`.
- Add input validation to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.  Handle potential errors during file operations.
