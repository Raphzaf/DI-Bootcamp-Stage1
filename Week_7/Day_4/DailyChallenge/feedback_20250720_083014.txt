suggestions for improvement:
- This code only renders a React app.  It's missing the crucial part: the implementation of the carousel using `react-responsive-carousel` and the image URLs provided in the instructions.
- The `App.js` file is missing, which is where the carousel component would be built.
- Add the necessary imports for `react-responsive-carousel` and import the image URLs.
