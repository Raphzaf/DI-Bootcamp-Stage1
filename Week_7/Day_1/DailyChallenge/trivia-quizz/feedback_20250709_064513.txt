suggestions for improvement:
- The `triviaQuestions` array should be imported into the router file rather than hardcoded in the main app.js file.
- Implement error handling for cases where a user tries to access a question beyond the array bounds or submits an invalid answer type.
- Add input validation to prevent issues with malicious or unexpected input.
- The feedback mechanism for correct/incorrect answers is missing.  The response should explicitly state whether the answer was right or wrong.
- The `/quiz/score` route is not implemented.  This is a critical requirement of the assignment.
- Consider using a session or other mechanism to store user progress between requests instead of relying on a single request.

suggestions for improvement:
- Use proper HTTP status codes for all responses. For example, use 200 OK for successful GET requests and 201 Created for successful POST requests.
- Implement input sanitization to prevent potential vulnerabilities like XSS attacks.  Don't just rely on toLowerCase() for answer comparison.
- Use environment variables or a configuration file for the trivia questions instead of hardcoding them.  This makes the code more flexible and maintainable.
- The `/quiz` route uses JSON responses for both starting the quiz and handling the answer submission, which isn't ideal from a user experience perspective. Consider separating the response formats (e.g. HTML for the quiz display).
- Add error handling for unexpected situations, such as the case where `req.body.answer` is missing or of an unexpected type.
