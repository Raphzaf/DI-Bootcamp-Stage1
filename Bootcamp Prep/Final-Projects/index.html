    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Edward Newgate, best known as Whitebeard, was the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates and one of the Four Emperors.
      He was considered the strongest man in the world after Gol D. Roger's death and ruled the seas for decades.
      Born on Sphinx Island, he never sought glory or power — only a family.

    <h2>A Father to His Crew</h2>
    <p>
      What made Whitebeard truly unique wasn't just his overwhelming strength, but his heart.
      He saw every one of his crewmates as his sons. That’s why they all called him “Father.”
      He protected, guided, and loved them as a true family. In a world of pirates, that made him a legend.
