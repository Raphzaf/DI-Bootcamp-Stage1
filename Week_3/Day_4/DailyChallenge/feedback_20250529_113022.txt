suggestions for improvement:
- The `cloneGroceries` function could include more explicit comments explaining the observations about pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference.
- The use of `'20$'` and `'35$'` for totalPrice is slightly unconventional.  Consider using a numerical value (20, 35) and adding the '$' sign during output if necessary for display purposes.
- Add a more descriptive log message when logging the user variable in `cloneGroceries` to avoid ambiguity
