suggestions for improvement:
- The code uses only one loop, fulfilling one of the requirements.  Add a second solution using nested loops to fully address the prompt.
- The `trim()` method is used to remove trailing spaces. While functional, it's slightly less efficient than building the string without trailing spaces in the first place. Consider a more efficient string building technique in both solutions.
- Add comments explaining the logic, especially for the single-loop approach, to enhance readability.
