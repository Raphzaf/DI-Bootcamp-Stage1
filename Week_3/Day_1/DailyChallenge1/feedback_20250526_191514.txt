suggestions for improvement:
- The variable names `wordNot` and `wordBad` could be more descriptive, perhaps `indexOfNot` and `indexOfBad` for better clarity.

- Consider using a more robust method to handle edge cases, such as sentences where 'not' or 'bad' might appear multiple times or with different capitalization.
