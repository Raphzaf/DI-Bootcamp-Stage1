suggestions for improvement:
- Add error handling for cases where elements (form, input, taskList) are not found.  This can happen if the HTML structure doesn't match expectations.
- The CSS for styling the 'done' class and the overall layout is missing.  Include a CSS file to style the elements as shown in the image.
- Improve the `renderTask` function by directly setting the `text-decoration` property of the label instead of relying on a CSS class. This approach provides more fine-grained control.
- Consider adding a unique identifier (UUID) instead of a simple incrementing number for `task_id` to prevent collisions, especially in more complex applications.
- Add a visual cue or indication to show the user that the task was successfully deleted or marked as complete.
- The code lacks accessibility features for screen readers. Add appropriate ARIA attributes to the elements.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is missing the JavaScript functionality to add tasks to the array and DOM, handle checkbox clicks (Bonus I), and delete tasks (Bonus II).
- Add event listeners for button clicks and checkbox clicks in the JavaScript code.
- Implement the `addTask`, `doneTask`, and `deleteTask` functions as described in the instructions.
- Use appropriate data structures (arrays of objects for Bonus I) to manage the task list efficiently.
- Include Font Awesome for the 'X' button as specified.
- Add error handling for empty input fields.
