suggestions for improvement:
- Add input validation to handle cases where the user doesn't fill in all the fields.  Currently, the story will still be generated, but may contain empty string placeholders.
- Implement the bonus 'shuffle' functionality.  The shuffle button is present in the HTML, but is hidden and not functional.
- Improve error handling. The current code lacks explicit error handling for cases where form inputs are missing or invalid.  A more robust solution would gracefully handle these situations.
- The stories should be stored in an array for easy random selection, instead of hardcoding them.

suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML is missing a shuffle button with the id 'shuffle-btn'.  Add `<button id="shuffle-btn">Shuffle</button>` to the form after the 'Lib it!' button.
- Add error handling for the case where `storyTemplates` is empty.  This could happen if the user submits the form without input.  This could also occur if `storyTemplates` is accidentally reassigned to an empty array at another point in the code.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `noun`, use `userNoun`).
- The code could benefit from separating concerns; create separate functions for getting form values, generating stories, and displaying the story.
